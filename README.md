# Custom Named Entity Recognition


Named entity recognition (NER) is a sub-task of information extraction (IE) that seeks out specified entities in a text. NER is used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

This repository contains an entities extractor in IPython Notebook format. Spacy library is used to simplify the implementation, instead of building the neural network from scratch.


Very small sample datasets of meeting scheduler are provided, which created and labeled by myself.
